title:  iHDI: Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction

*iHDI: Interdisciplinary workshop on Human-Drone Interaction*

*CHI 2020*<br>
*Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, USA*

<p class="abstract">
Human-drone interaction (HDI) is becoming an ubiquitous topic in daily life, and a rising research topic within CHI. Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform the design and scholarship of HDI, and interdisciplinary communication -- between design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities -- is essential to this end. The Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI) aims to bring together diverse perspectives; advancing HDI and its scholarship through a rich variety of participants and hands-on activities where an assortment of research, design, and prototyping methods are deployed. The workshop intends to serve as a platform for a diverse community that continuously builds on each other's methods and philosophies, towards results that *take off*.
</p>

Current HDI research field builds on a diverse motivations and methodologies, with contributions originating from various clusters worldwide. As HDI researchers in the CHI community, we observe significant potentials for expediting and compounding research efforts where different research efforts intersect. Thus we propose to hold an \textit{interdisciplinary} and hands-on HDI workshop with participants from an expansive variety of disciplines, including engineering, design, and humanities. Our goal is to build an enduring community of researchers who continue to learn from each other's methods and philosophies, continuing with impactful research contributions over the long term.

# Organizers

**Mehmet Aydın Baytaş** completed his PhD within Koç University's interdisciplinary Design, Technology and Society program. He is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellow at Qualisys AB, and a research affiliate at Chalmers University of Technology's t2i Lab. His current research, supported by [the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program -- Humanities and Society (WASP-HS)]https://wasp-hs.org/projects/the-rise-of-social-drones-a-constructive-design-research-agenda/) addresses the design space of autonomous drones operating in human-populated environments.

**Markus Funk** is a senior user experience researcher at Cerence. Inc, Germany. Markus is an expert in human-drone interaction and flying user interfaces.

**Sara Ljungblad** is an Assistant Professor at the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. She is interested in inclusive design methods and has done several long-term studies understand experiences of robotic products in everyday settings. She is currently funded by [WASP-HS]https://wasp-hs.org/projects/the-rise-of-social-drones-a-constructive-design-research-agenda/) to conduct constructive and critical design research on "social drones."

**Jérémie Garcia** is an Assistant Professor at ENAC, Toulouse, France. He is interested in designing interactions to author and operate automated systems including drones and air traffic control.

**Joseph La Delfa** is a PhD student in the School of Design at RMIT University. His research is focused on bodily awareness and reflection through HDI. His experiences in product design and engineering, from concept to production and maintenance, covers industries including glassware, hand tools, furniture, and service design.

**Florian 'Floyd' Mueller** is a Professor at RMIT University, where he directs the Exertion Games Lab. His research straddles the intersection of human-computer interaction, the body, and gaming; including the use of drones in exercise and recreation.

# Call for papers

Drones are becoming ubiquitous. Current applications include logistics, construction, security, emergencies, and photography. Emerging applications such as exercise, companionship, and tangible user interfaces are active research topics within the CHI community.

Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform new drone applications; and communication between different disciplines – design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities – is essential. To this end, the Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI) aims to intertwine diverse perspectives, as a platform for researchers and practitioners learning from each other.

We seek high quality contributions exploring HDI from a plethora of perspectives, including but not limited to: empirical research, engineering, design, theory, art, and opinions. Topics can include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Novel HDI experiences
* Theoretical and philosophical arguments on concepts and contexts
* Transferring learnings between HDI and other HCI or extracurricular topics
* Policy and regulatory issues
* Accessible HDI
* Prototyping and development tools
* Ethnographic fieldwork with users, developers, and bystanders

Authors are invited to submit 2- to 6-page position papers in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format, on or before February 11, 2020; at: [easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihdi2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihdi2020

The proceedings will be stored on the open archive [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/), indexed by Google Scholar. A paper on workshop outcomes will be submitted to a relevant venue. Selected contributions will be invited for publication in a special issue of the THRI journal.

At least one author must attend. Attendees must register for the workshop and at least one day of CHI 2020.
