He is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellow at Qualisys AB, and a research affiliate at Chalmers University of Technology's t2i Lab. His current research, supported by [the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program -- Humanities and Society (WASP-HS)]https://wasp-hs.org/projects/the-rise-of-social-drones-a-constructive-design-research-agenda/) addresses the design space of autonomous drones operating in human-populated environments.

**Markus Funk** is a senior user experience researcher at Cerence. Inc, Germany. Markus is an expert in human-drone interaction and flying user interfaces.

**Sara Ljungblad** is an Assistant Professor at the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. She is interested in inclusive design methods and has done several long-term studies understand experiences of robotic products in everyday settings. She is currently funded by [WASP-HS]https://wasp-hs.org/projects/the-rise-of-social-drones-a-constructive-design-research-agenda/) to conduct constructive and critical design research on "social drones."

**Jérémie Garcia** is an Assistant Professor at ENAC, Toulouse, France. He is interested in designing interactions to author and operate automated systems including drones and air traffic control.

**Joseph La Delfa** is a PhD student in the School of Design at RMIT University. His research is focused on bodily awareness and reflection through HDI. His experiences in product design and engineering, from concept to production and maintenance, covers industries including glassware, hand tools, furniture, and service design.

**Florian 'Floyd' Mueller** is a Professor at RMIT University, where he directs the Exertion Games Lab. His research straddles the intersection of human-computer interaction, the body, and gaming; including the use of drones in exercise and recreation.
