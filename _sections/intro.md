        The Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI) is a gathering for scholars of human-drone interaction (HDI) and related subjects, co-located with the [2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems](https://chi2020.acm.org/).
      </p>
      <p>
        Human-drone interaction (HDI) is becoming an ubiquitous topic in daily life, and a rising research topic within CHI. Knowledge from a wealth of disciplines can inform the design and scholarship of HDI, and interdisciplinary communication -- between design, engineering, social sciences, and humanities -- is essential to this end. The Interdisciplinary Workshop on Human-Drone Interaction (iHDI) aims to bring together diverse perspectives; advancing HDI and its scholarship through a rich variety of participants and hands-on activities where an assortment of research, design, and prototyping methods are deployed. The workshop intends to serve as a platform for a diverse community that continuously builds on each other's methods and philosophies, towards results that *take off*.

        Current HDI research field builds on a diverse motivations and methodologies, with contributions originating from various clusters worldwide. As HDI researchers in the CHI community, we observe significant potentials for expediting and compounding research efforts where different research efforts intersect. Thus we propose to hold an \textit{interdisciplinary} and hands-on HDI workshop with participants from an expansive variety of disciplines, including engineering, design, and humanities. Our goal is to build an enduring community of researchers who continue to learn from each other's methods and philosophies, continuing with impactful research contributions over the long term.
